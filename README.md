# SpaceInvaders
A Space Invaders project by Eshan Prakash.

All PNG files were manually drawn and resized by Eshan Prakash, inspired by the original Space Invaders sprites.

This is a much more efficient counterpart to my previous Galaga replica. It makes use of ArrayLists and classes in a much more efficient manner than the other project.

I like to imagine that this is a testament to my ability to learn from my mistakes an reapply my knowledge to much greater effect than before.
